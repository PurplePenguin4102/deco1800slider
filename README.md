# deco1800slider

A small project for our Deco1800 group _AuSlider_

The general idea is to use ReactJS to create a 3D sliding puzzle. I'm not sure on the rest of the technology stack yet.
I know I'll probably need Ajax, the Trove API (as per project spec) and something to deal with my JSON objects.

The M and C in my MVC data structure will both probable be handled by JQuery, but I may end up useing Ruby, I'm really not 
sure yet.
